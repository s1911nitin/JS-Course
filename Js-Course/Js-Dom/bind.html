            /*  project requirement - When an object or instance of React class is created
                all of sudden we need reference this of above button and using that reference 
                we will call a handler inside react class to execute something as well as
                inside that handler we also want the reference this of React class which 
                generally disappear when we call handler using different reference like button.
            */

            document
                    .querySelector("button")
                    .addEventListener("click", this.clickHandler.bind(this))

        }

        clickHandler(){
            console.log("React class reference:", this)
            console.log(this.server);
        }



    }

    const app = new React("library", "https://127.0.0.1:3000/")

    app.clickHandler()



    /*
        Note : 
        
        When we call clickHandler using current context object app so we will get a reference of current
        context object app only inside clickHandler in a form of this keyword due to which we can easily 
        get an access of this.library or this.server.

        But as our requirement says when we click on button so this time due to event listener we will
        call clickHandler using current context object of button in a form of this keyword and therefore
        we will have access of this keyword in a form of button object will be available only inside
        clickHandler method so we are not able to access React class instant variables inside clickHandler

        This is a huge problem how we can overcome this.


        We have one method called bind here which will help us to provide this of React class inside
        clickHandler even we will call clickHandler method using object of button still we will be able
        to get an access of React class current context object in a form of this,  This is what we were
        looking for.

        syntax :  document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", this.clickHandler.bind(this))


        Due to which we will be able to get an access of React class current context object inside clickHandler
        even it was called due to click event using button click.
